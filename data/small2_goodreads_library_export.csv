I enjoyed Hardy's style of writing and his ""contrived coincidences"" didn't bother me as much as people said that they would. I think this is a bit overly negative in terms of Hardy's representation of the human experience, but it was also accurate in terms of the time and reflected the social challenges of the time, especially for women. There were so many good quotes and insights about life in the writing. I was constantly underlining snippets of writing. I'd recommend this to someone who enjoys books written in a bit of an older style but with the classic feel and a driving plot. ",,,1,0

It had its good points, it selling points, one of which was, for me, that it was historical fiction, which I love, and it was about Henry VIII, another one of my favorite time periods in history. I was disappointed, though. Knowing that it's a story told through the eyes of one of Henry's most famous mistresses, I shouldn't have had such high hopes for it. But I did, and I was let down. I mean, I did like a lot of it. But I felt like it just dragged on so much. It went way too in-depth with every tiny thing. There's a fine line between detailed and boring, and Philippa Gregory crossed that line a hundred times through the course of the book. The basic plot was good, and I liked it. It was almost a satire of England at the time, of the corruption of Henry's reign, of the cycle that Anne Boleyn began by ousting Catherine and going from mistress to wife, which basically then became the goal of every woman in the court. It highlighted perfectly the decline of Henry's reign as he became consumed with his desire for a son so much so that it overshadowed every other aspect of his life and reign. But the book itself, while providing a detailed analysis and scathing criticism of the courts of Europe at the time, neglected to develop that in a well-written and thoughtfully crafted way. The writing was almost as shallow as its subject matter, focusing way more on the romance and the sex and the affairs than the actual plot, which went a lot deeper than that, or the characters, whose development was shoddy at best. I think the problem here is the classification. It's labeled as historical fiction, but in reality the only things historical about it are the characters and the basic events. This would be more accurately classified as a crappy romance novel, set among the ranks of other romance novels whose plot is never developed below the surface of the multiple affairs going on. If you cut out about a hundred pages of absolute nothingness that was totally unnecessary to the overall plot, you might have a barely-stomachable novel. A little fact-checking, working in some more historical nuances, improving the character development, and it would be infinitely better. But as it is, my expectations were definitely not lived up to.",true,,1,0

BAM. hits you right in the face like a truck, completely turned the plot around, set the stage nicely for the last book. so, it started out slow, but veronica roth really managed to make it all come together, full circle.

I don't know, I feel like Suzanne Collins' moment in the spotlight started and ended with The Hunger Games, and the next two novels were only her trying to make it last as long as possible. Plus, it's easier to make movies out of a series, I guess, if that's what you're getting at, especially for books that were so well-received by the majority. the movies for catching fire and mockingjay part 1 were admittedly better than the books, though, so maybe my dislike is just something about the way that the action played out in the book versus the way it played out on the screen, which, in my opinion, all came together a lot nicer. but, hey, this isn't a review of the movie, it's about the book, and bottom line is the book felt...
