It was a fascinating look at the history of cloning and some of the debates around the ethics and implications of cloning. I don’t really read much fiction, but I found this book at a thrift store and decided to read it and am glad that I did. I think I’ll be reading much more nonfiction in the future, as this helped me in developing my opinions on cloning and genetic engineering of humans and animals. While it was written some time ago, it’s still quite relevant today and is fascinating when considering the advances we have made in cloning since this book released. ",,,1,0
