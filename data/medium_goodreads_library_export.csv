Talese,Hardcover,568,2009,2009,2010/04/29,2010/04/28,,,read,"This is an interesting biography, but not historical as I expected. There are a number of anecdotes related from various sources, but they are not always well supported or integrated, and there is a lot of speculation. For example, the author speculates about Rand's psychological makeup without really delving into much detail. She relates some anecdotes about Rand's mother and her ""sometimes tyrannical"" presence at home, without giving a clear impression of what this means. I was confused about whether Rand's home life was oppressive or she was just an extremely arrogant individual (I suspect more of the latter than the former, given how she treated those around her). <br/><br/>The author makes a lot of excuses for her as well. For instance, Rand made a point of stating that ""deception"" had no place in the life of her idealized ""rational egoist,"" but then throughout her own life was responsible for some pretty extreme acts of deceit. The author excuses most of this by appealing to the hardships she had to endure, which while legitimately difficult hardly answer the objection on any rational grounds. It seems to me that Rand is her own worst enemy, and while her philosophy has appealing features it fails in practice because it does not account for the complexity of human nature.<br/><br/>Ayn Rand was an interesting person, a fantastic and prolific writer, but a little too full of herself and her mythos. She surrounded herself with worshipers, and had no time for critics. That came across well in the book- I suspect the author is more of a worshiper than a semi-objective biographer. I could think of better ways to spend my time, however... I won't be re-reading this one.",,,1,0
